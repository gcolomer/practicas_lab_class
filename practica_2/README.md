In this Machine Learning Problem we will be presented with a dataset that covers some transaction Frauds dataset_payments_fraud.csv. The objective of this practice is to create a complete study of the dataset and construct some ML models to be able to predict whether a client will commit fraud or not. Throughout this practice, we will analyse the dataset's data and compare the ML models, and finally, we will look at the model's interpretability, an essential part for understanding model predictions.
